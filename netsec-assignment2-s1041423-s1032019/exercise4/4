	2. Client queries root DNS server to find .org DNS server
	3. Client queries .org DNS server to find .example.org DNS server
	4. Client queries .example.org DNS server to find random.example.org DNS server

4.b
The most likely will be .org, as it is widely used for manny website addressses
The least likely will be random.example.org, 
as it is a very specific website address that probably is 
only used by one website.

4.c
Use the DNS cache to find out if the website was recently accessed, 
if it exists in the DNS cache, it was. Else, it was not.
If the resolver doesn't have to send query question for a domain name, then we know it's cached.


4.d
Yes, if the TTL is big then it is frequently looked up as it should then not be removed from the cache.

4.e
FQDN: www.printer.random.example.org
IPv4: 134.122.131.10

4.f
beta.random.example.org, 131.122.131.10

4.g
If one of the ip-addresses of an A record changes, the CNAME record pointing to that will also change.
It also saves up the processes of looking up the ip address.
