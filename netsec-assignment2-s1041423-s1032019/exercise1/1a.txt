From ATM to bank's server
1. PASSWD: ATM reads a card, and get pincode as input. iT sends the (hashed) pincode to the server 
if the server receives True value, it goes to the main page of the bank account. Otherwise output wrong password, if count=3, it will shows the account is blocked.
2. SELECT balance from users with userid = *****: If the password is true, the ATM allows the user to check balance. Then it will send a query for balance to the server
3. withdrawal= N: the atm sends a withdrawal request to the server. If it receives true, it will dispense cash to the client. If it recieces error message, it will output the error message on the screen.
4. We think the termination of a session takes place local. As if the person click finish, the card is being returned. 



From bank's server to ATM
1. PASS_CHECK== true: The server sends a reponde and tells if the passward matches the one in the database 
or 
PASS_CHECK == false, count+1: If the password is not corret, it sends false value along the number of the times wrong tries.  
2. BALANCE_RESULT: the server will look up the query and send it back to the ATM
3. Error or True   :The sevrver checks if the withdrawal>balance. If it is the case, it will pass the wrong message to the atm machine. Otherwise it will return true to the atm.
