1.TCP flow between Host A and Host b
B will send the Receive windows size to Host A along with an acknowledge message. So A know when to stop after sending out the a bunch of segements. When Host B sends to A that it has receive windwos size of 0, A wil stop, but in practice, A will continuously send  small segments to b to see if the receive window of B is relieved again.



The average speed: 50 mbps.  thats when the receive window is full, and then the host read 50 mbps from the receiver buffer and send this acknowledgement to A. A will in return send 50 mbps to the link, and link send 50mpbs to Host b.

The minimum speed is 0 Mbps when the receive window is full on the receiver side. Host A only waits and send 
nothing.

The maximum speed is 100 mbps until the buffer is full since that's the maximum speed allowed by the link, then afterwards 50 Mbps as shown in the average speed.
