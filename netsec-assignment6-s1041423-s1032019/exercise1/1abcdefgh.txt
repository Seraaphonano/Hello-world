a. For both virtual machinese, we used
fe80::1/64 and fe80::2/64 for the address of the eth1 interface.
Since, the interdace identifier has to be different, it doesn't matter with what ivalues we use.

b. sudo ip address add fe80::2/64 dev eth1  
   sudo ip address add fe80::1/64 dev eth1    
The above command is the command we used to set up the  ipv6 address for interface eth1

c. ping fe80::1%eth1
We used this command to ping the original vm with interface eth1


d. since different interfaces have different ip addresses. For example, if we set the command in c) to interface eth0, it doesn't work anymore.

e. It is advised to 7 bits for prefix and 41 bits for global id. We will follow this convention 

prefix we chose to be fd:
fd: 11111101 can have 7 bits, so prefix is 1111110
global id :  some random digits
l=1 because prefix is locally assigned 
fd88:dc1:1ac:002a:: /64 looks good


we set the serber address to be fd88:dc1:1ac:002a::1

range: fd88:dc1:1ac:002a::2 - fd88:dc1:1ac:002a:10


f)fd88:dc1:1ac:002a::9 on the clone eth1

g) Yes they worked

h)the ip address on the close has prefix length 128
IT doesn't matter because the forwarding table has the correct prefix length.
