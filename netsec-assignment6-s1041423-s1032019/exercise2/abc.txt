a.


For Subnet 1 : 192.168.1.001 A
	       192.168.1.002 B
	       192.168.1.003 Left router 1


     Subnet 2 : 192.168.2.001  C
     		192.168.2.002  D
     		192.168.2.003 right router 1
     		192.168.2.004 left router 2
     
     Subnet 3 : 192.168.3.001 E
		192.168.3.002 F
		192.168.3.003 right router 2
		

b.
1. E knows the forwarding table. E should know it needs to send the packet (192.168.3.003 ). Then the netword adapter
of E creates a packet with the mac address of router 2. 


2. E send it to router 2. Looks at the packet and knows it should sent the packet to the ip address
of the right side of router 1 (192.168.2.003 ) by looking up the forwarding table.

3. Router 1 looks at the packet and send it to B via mac address B_mac .



c. The APR in E has to look for the mac address of right side of router 2(192.168.3.003)
Host E will send an ARP query within the broadcast Ethernet frame. Router 2 will
receive the questions and send the answer back to Host E. 

Then the same prcoess in 2) will be carried out.
