1)
a.
The first route in the first table equals the first route in the second table. (second route in first table consequently equals the second route in second table)
We can see that in the first table genmask, flags, ref and use are shown which are not shown in the second table.
We can also see that in the second table protocol and src are shown which are not shown in the first table.

b.
All packets starting with a 0-bit will go through route 2 and all packets starting with a 1-bit will go through route 3.
No packets will go through default, since all those packets will be handled by either route 2 or 3 (depending on the first bit).

c.
Route 4, since it's destination is 10.50.9.0/24 which includes 10.50.9.1

d.
Route 6 is an exception upon all above routes which route all packets through eth0. 
Such a exception might be necessary when there is for instance a VPN connection and 172.16.20.23 is the address of the VPN.
