a) DTAG probably thought more companies will start to purchase their services.

b) We think the ISP should only charge the direct customers for the internet connection. Since this act will simple
encourage people to create good content. The content of the internet probably already has to spend something on maintaining their servers and content. It is also quite ridiculous to charge the content providers. For exmaple, if there is no useful content (no youtube, no netflix, no facebook), there is no need for people to have the internet services at the first place. 

c) This will create monopoly. For example, if kpn has most of the dutch internet content providing companies for it, and people have kpn internet can access to most website or games with good speed, then people will all changes from other ISP to KPN. Gradually KPN will have their control over the customers (since they have the fastest access to all websites), then they can increase their fees or offer bad services due to the lack of competition.
